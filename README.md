## 📖 About the Translation Platform

This project is an **Online Translation Order Management System** that covers the entire translation workflow from order submission to delivery.

### ✨ Features and Workflow
1. **User Registration & Login**  
   - Users can register and upload their files for translation.  
   - Supported file types: Word, PDF, Images (JPG, PNG), and ZIP archives.  

2. **Word Count Calculation**  
   - For Word or PDF files, the system automatically counts the words.  
   - If the file contains images, the operator is notified to manually determine the number of words in the images.  

3. **Translation Options**  
   Customers can choose options such as:  
   - Type of translation (general, specialized)  
   - Source and target language  
   - Translation quality level  
   - Proofreading / Editing  

4. **Invoice & Payment**  
   - The system generates an invoice based on the selected options and word count.  
   - Customers first pay **50% upfront**.  
   - After operator approval, the order is activated.  

5. **Translation Process**  
   - The operator assigns the file to the appropriate translator.  
   - The translator completes the translation and uploads the file back.  
   - Customers can download the final file after paying the remaining balance.  

6. **Multiple Files Support**  
   - Customers can upload multiple files at once (Word, PDF, Images, ZIP).  
   - Each file follows the same invoice, payment, and translation process.  

7. **Translator Payments**  
   - Every 15 days, the system automatically generates a payslip for each translator.  
   - Translators receive their payments based on completed work.  

8. **Access Levels**  
   - **Admin:** Full system management and settings.  
   - **Financial Operator:** Manages payments and transactions.  
   - **General Operator:** Handles orders and customer communication.  
   - **Translator:** Works on assigned files and uploads translations.  
   - **Customer:** Places translation orders and tracks their status.  
   - **Content Manager:** Publishes pages such as About Us, Contact Us, and articles.  

9. **Advanced Settings**  
   - Define translation types and pricing.  
   - Configure quality levels and related costs.  
   - Manage payment gateways and SMS services.  
   - Set up roles and access permissions.
